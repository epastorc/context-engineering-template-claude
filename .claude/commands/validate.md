# Implementation Validation

## Validation Checklist

### 1. Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Domain entities are pure business objects
- [ ] Application services contain business workflows
- [ ] Infrastructure layer handles external concerns
- [ ] Presentation layer only handles UI logic
- [ ] No circular dependencies between layers

### 2. SOLID Principles
- [ ] Single Responsibility: Each class has one reason to change
- [ ] Open/Closed: Code is open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] Liskov Substitution: Derived classes are substitutable
- [ ] Interface Segregation: Interfaces are specific and focused
- [ ] Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions, not concretions

### 3. TypeScript Quality
- [ ] No `any` types used
- [ ] Proper type definitions for all interfaces
- [ ] Strict TypeScript configuration followed
- [ ] Generic types used appropriately
- [ ] Null safety handled correctly

### 4. Angular Best Practices
- [ ] OnPush change detection where appropriate
- [ ] Proper lifecycle hook usage
- [ ] Services are injectable and singleton
- [ ] Reactive forms used over template-driven
- [ ] RxJS operators used correctly

### 5. Testing Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for all business logic
- [ ] Component tests for UI interactions
- [ ] Service tests for data operations
- [ ] Integration tests for workflows
- [ ] Mocking used appropriately

### 6. Code Quality
- [ ] Files under 500 lines
- [ ] Proper naming conventions
- [ ] JSDoc comments for public APIs
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed

### 7. Build and Deployment
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] Linting passes without errors
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Production build works
- [ ] No console errors in development

## Validation Commands
1. `ng build` - Check compilation
2. `ng lint` - Check code quality
3. `ng test` - Run unit tests
4. `ng serve` - Test in development

## Fix Common Issues
- Circular dependencies: Review import statements
- Type errors: Add proper type definitions
- Test failures: Update test mocks and expectations
- Linting errors: Follow project coding standards

Ensure all validation steps pass before considering the implementation complete.
